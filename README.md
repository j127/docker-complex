# Example Docker Application (multi-container)

This is an example of a multi-container Dockerized application based on a [video course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/).

Main technologies used:

- Docker (compose, image, container, hub, volume, network, etc.)
- Travis CI
- Nginx (2 containers, ports 80 and 3000)
- Express.js (API)
- React.js (SPA)
- Redis
- Postgres

I started to add deployment settings for AWS, but I'm not going to deploy there, so I've abandoned that branch.
